I was in a job interview today when the manager handed me his laptop and said, "I want you to try and sell this to me."
So I put it under my arm, walked out of the building, and went home.
Eventually, he called me on my phone and said, "Bring it back here right now!"
I replied, "Â£100 and it's yours."
